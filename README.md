# movie-recommender

This is a movie recommendation app that I created with a friend, Jun Han, in June/July 2023. It is supposed to leverage the IMDB API to provide movie recommendation based on user input.
However, IMDB API no longer has  afree option, so it won't work anymore. There is avideo recording of how it works for reference.

The tech stack used are Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
